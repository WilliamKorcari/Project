# Project for the Software and Computing exam.

## Conversion of a .root file (physics data) into a .csv file for the use in a TF NeuralNet.

The software developed for this project is basically divided in two main algorithms: one for the conversion of the data from **.root** to **.csv** file using the module "***uproot***" which can be found in the file "*data_converter.ipynb*" and one for the implementation of the neural network using **Keras/Tensorflow** modules which is in the file "*signal_classifier.ipynb*".

## Documentation.

### **data_converter.ipynb**:

get_file_name(fname = "analysis.root")
